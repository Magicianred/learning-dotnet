# OOP

- When you create a new object from a class, it's called an instance of that class. In C#, use the `new` keyword to create an object.
  
- When your program creates a new object, it gets added to the heap.

- An instance uses fields to keep track of things.

- Methods are what an object does. Fields are what the object knows. An object's behavior is defined by its methods, and it uses fields to keep track of it's state.
  
- When you use the `static` keyword to declare a field or method in a class, you don't need an instance of that class to access it.
  
- When a field is static, there's only one copy of it, and it's shared by all instances.
  
- An instance field creates a copy for every instance.
  
- Fields and methods of a class are its members.
  
- Refactoring means reading code you already wrote and making improvements without modifying its behavior.

- fields are private members of classes an intended to hide information.
  
- properties are public and can be thought of as wrapping the field and allows us to have control of what is put into and taking out of a field. 

- A callback is executable code that is passed as an argument to other code.
